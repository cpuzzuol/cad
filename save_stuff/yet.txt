ch1:
q11 (ulaby's q8): need the right answer.

ch3:
q9-q11 (ulaby's q3): need equations for the t/f answers. (Right now,
just "BOX MATH" for all 3.

q23  (ulaby's q3.6 last part): 
 "none of above 3 statements is true", should be replaced with the
 actual 3 statements(?)  or maybe just remove this question!
likely remove....

q48 & q49  (ulaby's q3.17)  NO DATA just shows question for 3.16!
likely just delete q49

============================
summary: need answers/math for: 1.8 and 3.3
